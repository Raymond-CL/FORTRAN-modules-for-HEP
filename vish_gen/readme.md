## vish-gen

### description

Generates a 3D table of parton paths traversing the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP),  
using the medium profile generated by Viscous Israel-Stewart Hydrodynamics (VISH).  
Please give credit to VISH by and the [codes](https://github.com/chunshen1987/VISHNew) can be found on github.  
The module also uses VEGAS multi-dimensional numerical integration which can be found in the same repository `vegas-min`.  

Let a particle with starting transverse coordinate $(x,y)$ and traversing along an orientation $\theta$,  
it propagates along a path overlapping with the expansion of the QGP medium.
The interaction between the medium and the particle is known as jet quenching.
