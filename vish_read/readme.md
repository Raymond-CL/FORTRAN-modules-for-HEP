## vish_read

### description

reads the 3D table generated by `vish_gen` module, which gives a quenching profile calculated using the hydrodynamic code Viscous Israel-Stewart Hydrodynamics (VISH).
This module is simply a read subroutine that reads the 3D table data from a file, and a function to perform 3D interpolation to give the corresponding value.

### note

- The settings in the module should be the same as the ones in `vish_gen` to have the same consistent format.
- The interpolation function takes in $x$, $y$ and $\theta$ as input.
- The periodic nature in the $\theta$ dimension is taken into account.
- The function uses simple linear interpolation, since the functional behaviour is not so complex.

### dependencies

the module is standalone
